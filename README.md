# FlappyFrickinBird
My very first Unity game build, with a flavor of Noob experience :)

This Repository contains all the assets and the logic scripts I built and implemented for my FlappyFrickinBird 2D game in Unity using C#.

>Made on Unity version 2022.3.2f1 on a 2D core empty template.

>Microsoft Visual Studio is recommended to edit game scripts.
